                good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the provisions of any law in force from time to time or

                4. Use of Cookies<span class="link"></span>
                The UJ BIT GANG Website use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is
                placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
                computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
                cookie to you.
                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is
                to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize UJ BIT GANG pages, or
                register with UJ BIT GANG site or services, a cookie helps UJ BIT GANG to recall your specific information on
                subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
                addresses, and so on. When you return to the same UJ BIT GANG Website, the information you previously provided can
                be retrieved, so you can easily use the UJ BIT GANG features that you customized.
                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
                modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
                experience the interactive features of the UJ BIT GANG services or Websites you visit.<br>
                <span class="link"> 5. Security of your Personal Information</span>
                UJ BIT GANG secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. UJ BIT GANG secures the
                personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
                unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to
                other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br>
                <span class="link"> 6. Changes to this Statement of Privacy</span>
                UJ BIT GANG will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. UJ BIT GANG encourages you to periodically review this Statement of Privacy to be informed of how UJ BIT GANG is
